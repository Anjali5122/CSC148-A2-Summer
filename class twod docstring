class TwoDTree(Tree):
    """ A TwoDTree class which is a subclass of class Tree.

    == Private Attributes ==
    _name: The name of the player or none if its an empty tree
    _point: the x/y coordinates of the player, also the dividing point of the
    rectangle
    _nw: the x/y coordinates of the north west corner of the rectangle described
    by this tree
    _se: the x/y coordinates of the south east corner of the rectangle described
     by this tree
    _lt: a 2D-tree that represents the either the north-most or west-most
    section of the rectangle
    _gt: a 2D-tree that represents the either the south-most or east-most
    section of the rectangle
    _split_type: a string indicating whether this rectangle should be split
    vertically or horizontally

    == Representation Invariants ==
    - all nodes must have _name and _point attributes unless they have no 
    descendants and no parents.
    - a node with no parents must have a _split_type == 'x'
    - a non-root node should have a value of None for both its _nw and _se 
    attributes.
    - a root node should not have a value of None for its _nw and _se attributes
    - a node with _split_type == 'x' must not have a parent or any children 
    with _split_type == 'x'
    - a node with _split_type == 'y' must not have a parent or any children 
    with _split_type == 'y'
    - all descendants of a given node p must have a _point that falls in the 
    rectangle described by _nw and _se
    - for a given node p, if _split_type == 'x' then:
        - all descendants d of p must be in p._lt if d._point[0] <= p._point[0] 
    and be in p._gt otherwise
    - for a given node p, if _split_type == 'y' then:
      - all descendants d of p must be in p._lt if d._point[1] <= p._point[1] 
    and be in p._gt otherwise
